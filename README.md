# EaglercraftX 1.12 test server

Dead simple debug/testing server for Eaglercraft 1.12 and 1.12.2
Servers can be found in their respective folders (Protocol 335 for 1.12 and protocol 340 for 1.12.2)

## How do I use this?
Basically, fork it, and run `java -jar bungee.jar` and `java -jar server.jar` in the corresponding folders, and it will run your very own Eaglercraft 1.12 server!

Use the paper jar instead of the default server jar for 1.12.2

## How do I customize the server name?
Go into the `web/` folder and click on the [eaglercraft_opts.js](web/eaglercraft_opts.js) file. Everything from default language, to default servers (and names!), to website title and icon, to default server to join on page load; can all be customized in this file.

## How do I make custom textures?
With our new-and-improved **EagTek:tm:** 2.0 technology, you can now use vanilla 1.12 resource packs in your client. *(Alternatively, to change the default textures, and without using server resource packs (which also work :D), you can still customize the .epk file using Ayun's [web-based tool](https://ayunami2000.github.io/ayunWebEPK))*

## Where can I find plugins?

- [Cuberite Plugins](https://plugins.cuberite.org)

## Where is singleplayer?
Go ask Peyton or something.
